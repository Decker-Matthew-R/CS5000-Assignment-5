Assignment 5

Assignment 5 was focused on Arrays.

Problem 1 required the user to enter values into an array. The program would than find the index of the largerst value (the largest value that appears first in the case of duplicates).

Problem 2 again allows the user to input values into an array. Once the values are entered, the array will be processed to create a new array with only distinct values. The program is repeatable.
